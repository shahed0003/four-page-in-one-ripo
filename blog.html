                 <p>It was only October 2013 when I began prepping myself for my first solo trekking trip in the Himalayas, Nepal. At the time, I had no clue what trekking was, and I had never had an interest in it. Things changed when my curiosity took over.</p>
                 <p>Since then, I have climbed Mt Chiang Dao in Thailand, Mt Fuji in Japan, Mt Rinjani in Indonesia, a few little canyon hikes in Australia, and I plan to celebrate this achievement with the climb of Mt Ngauruhoe in New Zealand.</p>
                 <p>Trekking has, without a doubt, changed my life forever. If you met me before, you would certainly know that it is impossible to shut me up when I start talking about my time in the mountains. That being said, I have learned so much, and through this post, I would like to channel my enthusiasm and list 10 things that I have learned so far.</p>

                <h5>Trip Planning</h5>
                 <p>No, the number of mountains you have climbed doesn't make it any easier to climb the next one. Mountains are mountains. You will be dirty as a hog, you will be exhausted, your back will hurt as f*ck, your feet will bleed, and you will be cold as balls.</p>
                 <p>But none of these will matter when you realize you have conquered yourself and accomplished what you thought was impossible. Imagine the places you will go if you know you are able to reach the Everest Base Camp with your own two feet. The endless possibilities!</p>

                <h5>Place To Visit</h5>
                 <p>People are generally good in nature. You see this more clearly when you are in the mountains. Mountains are a great equalizer. People from all walks of life will not hesitate to greet you in the mountains. They will encourage you, empower you, and assist you in any way possible. After all, we are all in this together.</p>
                 <p>Once you remove all your previous perceptions about people from different walks of life, everyone becomes your friend. Some, you may feel more connected to than your friends back home.</p>
